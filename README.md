My reproduction of a study in fraud detection. The initial paper can be found at <http://worldcomp-proceedings.com/proc/p2013/DMI8055.pdf>.

##Progress
+ Designed hash tables for quick time window lookups
+ Sucessfully reproduced feature generation
+ Optimized for dplyr operations

##TODO
+ Finish calculating the features for every column (e.g. Make, DriverRating, Gender)
+ Calculate two one-class Support Vector Machines
+ Calculate Random Forest classifier
